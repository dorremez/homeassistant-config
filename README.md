# Dor Remez (DR.ex) Home Assisatant Configuration

I'm using only Lovelace UI, some of my Dashboard is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/dmatik">dmatik's</a> design.
I use mostley <a href="https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card">Custom:Button-Card</a> to design my dashboard, and I use <a href="https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod">Browser_mod</a> quite a bit, pretty useful as far as I see it :)<br>

This is a good chance to say "Big Thanks!" to all the kind people from the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ayZ3Kkg">Home Assistant Discord (Israel)</a><br>
who were patient enough to help me along the way. <br>

I'm always looking for new ideas and insperation and I'm still learning as I go,<br>
so if you have any suggestions or remarks, <br>
feel free to contact me! :)<br>
